// js is a single threaded , synchronous blocking language.
// js is a case sensitive language.
// + operator is those which works for both number and string.
// 1 + 1 = 2
// "1" + "1" = "11"
// 1 + "1" = "11" (if there is war between number and string , string operator always wins.)

// by default a function will return undefined value.

// all array method returns somethings, 
// but push, pop, Unshift and shift method changes original array.
// reverse, sort method return as well as change original array.

// in primitives
// for every let a now memory space is created

// in non primitives
// if there is let a new memory space is created but first it see weather the variable is copy of another variable
// if the variable is copy of another variable then at the time
// it will not create memory for that variable rather it share memory
// in primitives === check whether value is same
// in noprimitive === check whether the share same memory location.
// setTimeout is 
// Node has its special memory
// any thing that push task to the background that is called asynchronous function.
// call stack are those which runs javascript code.
// if call stack is empty asynchronous task is transfer into 


We cannot declare same variable twice in the same block
  
  Scope of variable.
    A variable inside its block only.
    Inside block it is known from where it is define.
